      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Algebraic equations are the foundation of higher mathematics and have countless applications in science, engineering, economics, and everyday problem-solving. Whether you're a student struggling with algebra homework or an adult who wants to refresh their mathematical skills, this guide will provide you with systematic approaches to solve different types of algebraic equations.</p>
      
      <h2>Understanding Algebraic Equations</h2>
      
      <h3>What is an Algebraic Equation?</h3>
      <p>An algebraic equation is a mathematical statement that asserts the equality of two expressions. It typically contains at least one variable (usually represented by letters like x, y, or z) whose value is unknown and needs to be determined.</p>
      
      <h3>Types of Algebraic Equations</h3>
      <p>Algebraic equations come in various forms, each requiring specific solving techniques:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Linear equations:</strong> Contain variables with a power of 1 (e.g., 2x + 3 = 7)</li>
        <li><strong>Quadratic equations:</strong> Contain variables with a maximum power of 2 (e.g., x² + 5x + 6 = 0)</li>
        <li><strong>Polynomial equations:</strong> Contain variables with integer exponents (e.g., x³ - 4x² + 2 = 0)</li>
        <li><strong>Rational equations:</strong> Contain fractions with variables (e.g., 1/x + 2 = 3/x)</li>
        <li><strong>Radical equations:</strong> Contain variables under a radical sign (e.g., √(x + 2) = 3)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Fundamental Principles of Equation Solving</h2>
      
      <h3>The Balance Principle</h3>
      <p>The key to solving equations is maintaining equality. Whatever operation you perform on one side of the equation, you must perform the same operation on the other side. This is often referred to as "keeping the equation balanced."</p>
      
      <h3>Basic Operations for Solving Equations</h3>
      <p>There are four basic operations you can perform while maintaining equality:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Addition:</strong> Add the same value to both sides</li>
        <li><strong>Subtraction:</strong> Subtract the same value from both sides</li>
        <li><strong>Multiplication:</strong> Multiply both sides by the same non-zero value</li>
        <li><strong>Division:</strong> Divide both sides by the same non-zero value</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>The Goal of Equation Solving</h3>
      <p>The ultimate goal when solving an equation is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation, with everything else on the other side.</p>
      
      <h2>Solving Linear Equations</h2>
      
      <h3>Step-by-Step Approach</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Simplify each side of the equation by combining like terms</li>
        <li>Move all variable terms to one side of the equation</li>
        <li>Move all constant terms to the other side</li>
        <li>Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Example 1: Simple Linear Equation</h3>
      <p>Solve for x: 2x + 3 = 7</p>
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The equation is already simplified</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Subtract 3 from both sides</p>
      <p>2x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3</p>
      <p>2x = 4</p>
      <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Divide both sides by 2</p>
      <p>2x ÷ 2 = 4 ÷ 2</p>
      <p>x = 2</p>
      
      <h3>Example 2: Linear Equation with Variables on Both Sides</h3>
      <p>Solve for x: 3x - 4 = 5x + 8</p>
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The equation is already simplified</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Subtract 5x from both sides</p>
      <p>3x - 4 - 5x = 5x + 8 - 5x</p>
      <p>-2x - 4 = 8</p>
      <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add 4 to both sides</p>
      <p>-2x - 4 + 4 = 8 + 4</p>
      <p>-2x = 12</p>
      <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Divide both sides by -2</p>
      <p>-2x ÷ (-2) = 12 ÷ (-2)</p>
      <p>x = -6</p>
      
      <h2>Solving Quadratic Equations</h2>
      
      <h3>Method 1: Factoring</h3>
      <p>Factoring is often the quickest method when the quadratic expression can be easily factored.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Arrange the equation in standard form: ax² + bx + c = 0</li>
        <li>Factor the left side of the equation</li>
        <li>Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Solve x² + 5x + 6 = 0</p>
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The equation is already in standard form</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Factor the left side</p>
      <p>(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0</p>
      <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Set each factor equal to zero</p>
      <p>x + 2 = 0 or x + 3 = 0</p>
      <p>x = -2 or x = -3</p>
      
      <h3>Method 2: Quadratic Formula</h3>
      <p>The quadratic formula works for any quadratic equation and is especially useful when factoring is difficult.</p>
      <p><strong>Formula:</strong> x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a) for the equation ax² + bx + c = 0</p>
      
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Solve 2x² - 7x + 3 = 0</p>
      <p>Here, a = 2, b = -7, and c = 3</p>
      <p>x = (-(-7) ± √((-7)² - 4(2)(3))) / (2(2))</p>
      <p>x = (7 ± √(49 - 24)) / 4</p>
      <p>x = (7 ± √25) / 4</p>
      <p>x = (7 ± 5) / 4</p>
      <p>x = 3 or x = 1/2</p>
      
      <h3>Method 3: Completing the Square</h3>
      <p>This method is particularly useful for deriving the quadratic formula and for certain applications in calculus and beyond.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Arrange the equation so that the constant term is on the right side</li>
        <li>If the coefficient of x² is not 1, divide all terms by this coefficient</li>
        <li>Complete the square on the left side by adding and subtracting (b/2)²</li>
        <li>Rewrite the left side as a perfect square</li>
        <li>Solve for x</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Solve x² + 6x + 8 = 0</p>
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Move the constant term to the right side</p>
      <p>x² + 6x = -8</p>
      
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Half the coefficient of x, square it, and add/subtract it</p>
      <p>Half of 6 is 3, and 3² = 9</p>
      <p>x² + 6x + 9 = -8 + 9</p>
      <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Rewrite the left side as a perfect square</p>
      <p>(x + 3)² = 1</p>
      <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Take the square root of both sides</p>
      <p>x + 3 = ±1</p>
      <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Solve for x</p>
      <p>x = -3 ± 1</p>
      <p>x = -2 or x = -4</p>
      
      <h2>Solving Systems of Linear Equations</h2>
      
      <h3>Method 1: Substitution</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Solve one equation for one variable in terms of the other</li>
        <li>Substitute this expression into the other equation</li>
        <li>Solve the resulting equation with one variable</li>
        <li>Substitute the value back to find the other variable</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Solve the system</p>
      <p>x + y = 5</p>
      <p>2x - y = 4</p>
      
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Solve the first equation for y</p>
      <p>y = 5 - x</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Substitute into the second equation</p>
      <p>2x - (5 - x) = 4</p>
      <p>2x - 5 + x = 4</p>
      <p>3x - 5 = 4</p>
      <p>3x = 9</p>
      <p>x = 3</p>
      <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Substitute x = 3 back to find y</p>
      <p>y = 5 - 3 = 2</p>
      <p>Solution: x = 3, y = 2</p>
      
      <h3>Method 2: Elimination</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Multiply one or both equations by constants to make the coefficients of one variable the same (but opposite in sign)</li>
        <li>Add the equations to eliminate one variable</li>
        <li>Solve for the remaining variable</li>
        <li>Substitute back to find the other variable</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Using the same system</p>
      <p>x + y = 5</p>
      <p>2x - y = 4</p>
      
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Add the equations directly (the y terms will cancel)</p>
      <p>x + y = 5</p>
      <p>2x - y = 4</p>
      <p>-----------------</p>
      <p>3x = 9</p>
      <p>x = 3</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Substitute x = 3 into either original equation</p>
      <p>3 + y = 5</p>
      <p>y = 2</p>
      <p>Solution: x = 3, y = 2</p>
      
      <h2>Solving Rational Equations</h2>
      
      <h3>Step-by-Step Approach</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Find the least common denominator (LCD) of all fractions</li>
        <li>Multiply all terms by the LCD to clear fractions</li>
        <li>Solve the resulting equation</li>
        <li>Check your solutions in the original equation to avoid extraneous solutions</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Solve 1/x + 2 = 3/x</p>
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The LCD is x</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Multiply all terms by x</p>
      <p>1 + 2x = 3</p>
      <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Solve for x</p>
      <p>2x = 2</p>
      <p>x = 1</p>
      <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Check the solution</p>
      <p>When x = 1: 1/1 + 2 = 3/1</p>
      <p>1 + 2 = 3</p>
      <p>3 = 3 ✓</p>
      
      <h2>Solving Radical Equations</h2>
      
      <h3>Step-by-Step Approach</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Isolate the radical term on one side of the equation</li>
        <li>Raise both sides to the power that will eliminate the radical</li>
        <li>Solve the resulting equation</li>
        <li>Check all solutions in the original equation to avoid extraneous solutions</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Solve √(x + 2) = 3</p>
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The radical is already isolated</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Square both sides</p>
      <p>(√(x + 2))² = 3²</p>
      <p>x + 2 = 9</p>
      <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Solve for x</p>
      <p>x = 7</p>
      <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Check the solution</p>
      <p>When x = 7: √(7 + 2) = √9 = 3 ✓</p>
      
      <h2>Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h2>
      
      <h3>Mistake 1: Incorrect Application of Operations</h3>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> In solving 2x + 3 = 7, dividing only the 2x term by 2 instead of the entire left side.</p>
      <p><strong>Correction:</strong> Always apply operations to the entire side of the equation.</p>
      
      <h3>Mistake 2: Forgetting to Check for Extraneous Solutions</h3>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> When solving √(x - 1) = -2, squaring both sides gives x - 1 = 4, so x = 5. But checking this in the original equation: √(5 - 1) = √4 = 2, not -2.</p>
      <p><strong>Correction:</strong> Always verify solutions in the original equation, especially when dealing with rational or radical equations.</p>
      
      <h3>Mistake 3: Arithmetic Errors</h3>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Calculating 3 × 4 as 7 instead of 12.</p>
      <p><strong>Correction:</strong> Work carefully and double-check your arithmetic, or use our <a href="/tools/math-evaluator">Math Expression Evaluator</a> for verification.</p>
      
      <h2>Real-World Applications of Algebraic Equations</h2>
      
      <h3>Finance</h3>
